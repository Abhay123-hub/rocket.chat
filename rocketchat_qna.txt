Question: How can I extend the functionality of my Rocket.Chat workspace?
Answer: To enhance your workspace's capabilities, you have several options:

- **Submit a Pull Request:** Modify the source code directly to implement new features. This approach offers maximum flexibility but requires familiarity with the codebase.

- **Use Integrations:** Create simple scripts that execute when messages are sent or received in a channel. Integrations are quick to develop but have limited scope.

- **Build a Rocket.Chat App:** Develop apps that interact with the user interface and execute custom routines on various triggers. This method provides a balance between power and complexity and allows for distribution via the Rocket.Chat Marketplace.

Each method has its strengths and can be chosen based on your specific requirements and technical expertise.

Question: How do I deploy Rocket.Chat on Apple Silicon Macs (M-series)
Answer: It is likely to get this error:

-The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested. 

-Follow the steps below to resolve it:

-Ensure you have Rosetta 2 on your Mac; this allows the M-series Macs to run Intel-based applications. Confirm this by running:


-arch -x86_64 uname -m

-If Rosetta 2 is installed, this command will output “x86_64.” If not, macOS will prompt you to install Rosetta 2.

-Open Docker Desktop, navigate to Settings > General and enable Rosetta for Docker Desktop. This allows Docker to emulate x86_64/amd64 architecture 

In the compose.yml file, add “platform: linux/amd64” to the rocketchat service.

-Next, add “EXPERIMENTAL_DOCKER_DESKTOP_FORCE_QEMU: 1” to the mongodb service environment. This forces the service to use the correct emulation settings.

-Now, run docker compose up -d

-Your Rocket.Chat instance should now be accessible via http://localhost:3000.

Question: Why do I receive a question about the Unique ID change detected?
Answer: **Unique ID** is the unique identifier of a server. It's a hash created when the Rocket.Chat's deployment starts for the first time.

-To prevent Unique ID duplication caused by deployment clones, splits, etc., when the database is copied to start a new deployment, the Unique ID record is also copied, and it becomes the same for the old and new deployments. Rocket.Chat implements a fingerprint solution to help admins identify when those cases happen by mistake.

The fingerprint is composed of the site URL setting and database connection string. When some parts of these two change, the fingerprint changes to a pending state. The admins are then requested to validate the fingerprint again by deciding if the change is, in fact, an expected update of the current workspace or a new workspace deployment.

-**Configuration update**

If the change detected was expected to be a normal workspace configuration change, like a site URL change or a database string change, it's safe to confirm it. By confirming the update, nothing will change and the new fingerprint will become validated.

If the change is a new workspace, by confirming it as an update, it can generate issues with statistics reporting, license validation, push notifications, marketplace access, etc. since more than one workspace is accessing the cloud services using the same unique ID.

-**New workspace**

If the change detected, in fact, means a new deployment has been done, by confirming a new workspace, all the identification information will be reset:

-**Unique ID:** A new unique hash will be generated.

-**Cloud connection:** All cloud connections will be reset.

-**Cloud workspace:** The cloud workspace data linking a cloud instance to the deployment will be reset.

-**Cloud license:** Any license provided by the cloud portal will be reset.

-If the change is not a new workspace, confirming a new workspace can generate issues when connecting the deployment to the cloud workspace.

Question: When will my snap installation get the latest release?
Answer: Snaps are one of our biggest install base. They are also auto-updating. As a result, we like to spend more time testing before releasing. Updated Snaps are usually released around the 15th of the month - around two weeks after a new release. This gives us time to look for issues, so you don't have to. If you have special requirements and need to use the latest release immediately, please consider another installation method, e.g., Docker.

Question: How do I add an option to mount media?
Answer: The interface providing the ability to access removable media is not automatically connected upon installation, so if you'd like to use external storage (or otherwise use a device in /media for data), you need to give Snap permission to access removable media by connecting that interface:

```bash
sudo snap connect rocketchat-server:removable-media```

Question: What do LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth, and SAML mean?
Answer: **Directory service**
A directory service is a shared system that helps organize and manage various items and network resources, such as files, users, printers, and devices. Examples include Microsoft AD, NetIQ eDirectory, and Apache Directory.
**LDAP**
Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is a protocol designed to enable easy access to and management of distributed directory information services over an IP network.
**SAML**
Security Assertion Markup Language(SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, particularly between an identity provider and a service provider.
**OAuth**
OAuth is a widely used open standard for granting websites and apps access to users' information on other platforms, without revealing passwords. Examples include Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
Source: https://docs.rocket.chat/docs/identity-management-faq
Category: Identity & Authentication
--------------------------------------------------
Question: Why is identity management crucial?
Answer: Integrating with your organization's user directory ensures timely updates to user access. For instance, when someone joins the organization, their Rocket.Chat account is automatically created, and when they leave, their account is promptly deactivated. This becomes more crucial as the user scale increases.

--------------------------------------------------
Question: How can I prevent disabled LDAP users from logging into Rocket.Chat?
Answer: Use the [Sync User Active State](https://docs.rocket.chat/v1/docs/ldap-premium-settings#advanced-sync) setting in Advanced Sync. Please be aware that compatibility with all LDAP servers is not guaranteed.
Source: https://docs.rocket.chat/docs/identity-management-faq
Category: Identity & Authentication
--------------------------------------------------
Question: Why can't I log in even though the setup seems correct?
Answer: If you're unable to log in without receiving error messages (and the last log entry is 'Attempt to bind'), ensure that the LDAP account username doesn't match any local account username on your workspace. For instance, if you have a local user with the username 'joe', enabling LDAP and attempting to log in with the same username 'joe' from your LDAP server may fail without providing an error message. In this case, you won't be able to log in using 'joe,' your LDAP password, or your local password.

Look into the third column (Current) that logs the current state of the services.

Another option is to use the systemctl command. To quickly check if a service is active or not, use the is-active subcommand or the more well-known status subcommand. See the table below to know the name of the service you want to inspect.

| Service      | Snap Service Name     | Systemd Service Name                        |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| MongoDB     | `rocketchat-mongo`    | `snap.rocketchat-server.rocketchat-mongo`  |

 ```bash
systemctl is-active snap.rocketchat-server.rocketchat-mongo 
 systemctl is-active snap.rocketchat-server.rocketchat-caddy 
 systemctl is-active snap.rocketchat-server.rocketchat-server
